# blabla
Hardware implementation of the BlaBla version of the ChaCha stream cipher.

Repo created. Not completed. Does not work.
**Do. Not. Use.**


## Introduction
BlaBla is a version of ChaCha develped by JP Aumasson. The big difference is that
the Blake2b permutation is being used. The reference implementation by Aumasson
is here: https://github.com/veorq/blabla

The big benefit compared to ChaCha is the doubled block size and thus that the
number of bytes/cycles increeases. This is of course a HW implementation which
means that the number of registers will increase, the logic will increase and
the clock frequency will be decreased. How much? Too early to say.

Basically we take the ChaCha core and change what is needed. This includes the
Python model.
